    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <h3>We are a global yarn manufacturer providing high-quality fibers to the textile industry for over 20 years.</h3>

    <p><centre><strong>Management and maintaining quality are an ongoing process hence at Yarn industry we strive hard to consistently improve the quality of our products. We take pride in sharing the fact that we are the first textile mill in the country and 10th in the world to achieve the USTERIZED certificate awarded by USTER technology after carefully evaluating each step of production and entire processes at “ARSALAN YARN TEXTILE”.</strong</centre></p>
  <br>
  <p><centre><strong>We have setup a separate entity to carefully and thoroughly check each step of production and evaluate the deliverable continuously during the production process, the quality assurance staff works as an independent department and put into practice the latest industry standards to ensure expected outcomes. The systems used by climate controls labs are as per the ISO 139 standard.</strong</centre></p>

    <p><centre><strong>We have developed a 3-tier system certified by USTER Technologies; this system checks the entire process from the selection of cotton till the production of final yarn until it is delivered to the customers in order to make sure there are no flaws in the product. Every 6 months we review the feedback of our valuable customers to keep track of our performance and set milestones to bring improvement.</strong</centre></p>
